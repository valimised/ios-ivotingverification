iOS based vote verification application for Estonian i-voting system

The intention behind this repository is to make source code of the official i-vote verification application for Estonian internet-voting system available for public review.

The repository is not used for active development, but will be kept up to date, so the code that can be found here is the code that is used for election. As the voting system used for legally binding elections must strictly follow the legislation, the actual development of Estonian i-voting system and i-vote verification application is supervised by Estonian State Electoral Office (ESEO, www.valimised.ee). Please refer to www.valimised.ee for further information.
